# Digit Classifier 
   
This is an in progress webapp to implement a neural network that classifies handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using python with numpy 
   
`$ python -i test.py`  
`>>> image_to_number('sample_images/4.png')`  
  
As of now, you can run test.py in interactive mode and call the image_to_number() function to test against any sample images.
